# Code Samples
We realise that getting started with SLIP Future and Google Maps Engine may not be the easiest task - particularly if you aren't a spatial nerd - so we've put together some code samples and demo apps to help developers get off to a flying start.

We're going to work to expand our library of code samples over time and welcome suggestions for any new examples that you'd like to see - [let us know]().

## Web Maps
### OpenLayers
A selection of samples using the [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org) web mapping library.

* [A simple map overlaying Landgate's aerial photography with the cadastre](https://github.com/Landgate/gme-code-samples/blob/master/wms/openlayers2.html)
* [An example of a more advanced map using the Swipe plugin to compare the Stoneville Fires aerial photography](https://github.com/Landgate/gme-code-samples/blob/master/wms/openlayers2-swipev2.html)
* [A demonstration of accessing Landgate's aerial photography as a WMTS service](https://github.com/Landgate/gme-code-samples/blob/master/wmts/openlayers2.html)

### Google Maps JavaScript API
A selection of examples using the [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/visualization).

* [A simple map overlaying the water pipe network on Landgate's aerial photography](https://github.com/Landgate/gme-code-samples/blob/master/google-maps-js-api-v3/MapsEngineLayer.html)
* [A demonstartion of the *DynamicMapsEngineLayer* class to highlight features on selection](https://github.com/Landgate/gme-code-samples/blob/master/google-maps-js-api-v3/DynamicMapsEngineLayer.html)

### Leaflet
Coming Soon!

## Access Raw Data
### The Google Maps Engine API
A selection of samples using the [Google Maps Engine API](https://developers.google.com/maps-engine/documentation/before-you-begin).

* [An example of retrieving features for a given geographic area: Downloads all bus stops in the South West of WA](https://github.com/Landgate/gme-code-samples/blob/master/gme-api/get-features-in-polygon.php)
* [An advanced example using the API to create an empty vector table, populate it with features, and then modify and delete its features](https://github.com/Landgate/gme-code-samples/blob/master/gme-api/create-update-delete-features.php)
* [A simple example of how to retrieve all of the maps your account has access to in SLIP Future](https://github.com/Landgate/gme-code-samples/blob/master/gme-api/my-maps.php)
* [A demonstration of searching for all layers in SLIP Future that cover a certain geographic area](https://github.com/Landgate/gme-code-samples/blob/master/gme-api/search.php)


## Demo Apps
### FindMyMineSite
An advanced example of combining the Google Maps JavaScript API and the Google Maps Engine API to provide an interactive web map allowing users to locate mine sites within range of a given town site.
