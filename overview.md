# Welcome to SLIP Future

This is the technical documentation for SLIP Future $LINK$, Western Australia's spatial data platform.

SLIP Future is administered by Landgate and runs on Google's new cloud-based Maps Engine $LINK$ platform. Data are available as clear and simple GeoJSON via a RESTful API, via OGC services #LINK#, via simple out-of-the-box 2D and 3D viewers, and as a direct download.

Most of the data is made available under the WALIS... $info here about WALIS and CC licensing + a LINK$.
