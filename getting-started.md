Registering to access data in SLIP Future is as simple as using your existing Google account or creating a new account at [Google Account Signup](http://accounts.google.com). If you have an existing email address (i.e. a work email, or another email provider) you can simply create a new account linked to that email as well.

Once you have your Google account setup and you're logged in you'll be able to:

* Create API keys to access public data on the [Google Developers Console](https://cloud.google.com/console/project)
* Create OAuth2 clients to use the full capabilities of the GME API and any private data you have been granted access to
* Login to the Google Maps Engine console and adminster your maps and data services (Editors Only)
